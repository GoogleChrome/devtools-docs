<h1>Editing styles & DOM</h1>






<p>The <strong>Elements</strong> panel lets you see everything in one DOM
tree, and allows inspection and on-the-fly editing of DOM elements.
You will often visit the Elements tabs when you need to identify the HTML snippet for
some aspect of the page. For example, you may be curious if an image has an HTML
id attribute, and what that attribute's value is.
</p>
<p>
The Elements panel is sometimes a better way to "view source" for a page. Inside
the Elements panel, the page's DOM will be nicely formatted, easily showing you HTML
elements, their ancestry and their descendants. Too often, pages you visit will have
minified or simply ugly HTML which makes it hard to see how the page is structured.
The Elements panel is your solution for viewing the real underlying structure of the page.
</p>

<p>Follow the steps below to explore the <strong>Elements</strong> panel:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Open the <a href="http://closure-library.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/closure/goog/demos/hovercard.html"
  target="_blank">Google Closure Hovercard demo page</a>.</li>

  <li>Open the Developer Tools window as described in the <a href="/chrome-developer-tools/docs/overview.html#access">How to Access the Developer Tools</a> section.</li>

  <li>If it is not already selected, select <strong>Elements</strong>.
  <div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_panel.png"></div> This shows the
  page's HTML elements in the main pane, and styles, metrics, properties,
  and event listeners in the right-hand sidebar. If Developer Tools opened
  via the Inspect Element action, it is automatically drilled down to
  and highlighted the element under mouse. This is very useful when you are
  curious which HTML generated a particular page element.</li>
</ul>

<h2>DOM Elements Tree</h2>

<p>Elements tree, including its inline scripts and styles are syntax highlighted.
For example, select the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag. You should see something like the following:
  <div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_css_syntax_highlighting.png"></div>
</p>

<p>Select the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element in the main window, you should see
something like this:
  <div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_p.png"></div>This lets you add,
  edit, or delete attributes for the selected DOM element - the
  <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element currently has no attributes. Typing or pasting
  in attributes on the highlighted lines adds them to the DOM element.
  Deleting text deletes the attribute.

  <ul>
    <li>You can edit node attributes in the main pane via double clicking
    them or pressing <b>Enter</b> key while on an element. <b>Tab</b> will
    iterate over the editable attributes.</li>
    <li>You can delete selected nodes using <b>Del</b> key.</li>
    <li>You can drag-and-drop an element to change its position within its parent, or even move the element to a different parent.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>CSS Styles</h2>

<p>The cascading nature of CSS makes the Styles browser in the Elements tab very useful.
Sometimes, styles collapse onto themselves and unintended visuals appear. Knowing which
styling rule the browser is applying to the element helps you debug such an issue.</p>

<p>Click the magnifying glass icon to turn on inspect mode. Return to the
Google Closure Hovercard page and click the top-left card, Tom Smith.
Because you are in inspect mode, this highlights the corresponding node in
the <strong>Elements</strong> panel and displays its associated styles,
then turns off inspect mode.
  <div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_hover.png"></div>
</p>

<p>You'll see that we're able to tell all the style attributes that are being applied.
For example, the padding comes directly from the <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element's
<code>class == anchor</code> attribute. The font is first defined for <code>body</code>,
but then overriden by the <code>.anchor</code>. There is also the <code>font</code> property
specified that is not recognized by the rendering engine. Properties like this are marked
with the triangle warning sign to the left.</p>

<p>While it's great to see the individual styles and where they come from,
it's also very useful to see the final set of styles after it is computed and
applied to the element. You can see the final product by selecting the
<strong>Computed Style</strong> section and explore styles as rendering engine
perceives them.</p>

<p>Now, hover over the <b>.anchor</b> editable style rule in the sidebar to see
checkboxes that let you disable individual properties. You should see
something like this:
  <div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_style_checkboxes.png"></div>You
  can disable a property by de-selecting it.
</p>

<p>Click an editable (non-grayed-out) style property name or value to edit them.
For example, double-click the <strong>margin: 20px</strong> property. You
should see something like this:
  <div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_style_edit.png"></div>

Autocompletion suggestions will appear while editing property names and values.
To add a new style property, click anywhere in the editable style declaration
whitespace. The new property will be added immediately after the clicked style
declaration. If you edit a style property value with a number, you can use the
<strong>Up</strong> or <strong>Down</strong> keys to change the number.
Holding the <strong>Alt/Option</strong> key steps by 0.1, holding the
<strong>Shift</strong> key steps by 10. You can add more properties via
double-clicking white area to the left / bottom of existing entries or
via pasting multiple properties separated with semicolon. You can start
editing of style rule selectors by clicking them. You can also add
new style rules using the <b>Gear Menu</b>, located to the right of
the Styles section bar.</p>

  <div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_style_completion.png"></div>
<br/>
<p>You can add a new style selector using the <span><img src="elements-files/plus.png"></span> button found in the <strong>Styles</strong>
section bar. In order to emulate an element's pseudostate (:active, :hover, :focus, :visited), use the
<span><img src="elements-files/attributes.png"></span> in the Styles pane header. In will bring up a small pane where you can select
which pseudostates of the selected element should be activated. </p>

<h2>Box Model</h2>

<p>Open the <strong>Metrics</strong> pane in the right-hand side-bar, then
double-click one of the metrics values.
  <div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_metrics.png"></div>This lets you
  edit any of the absolute, relative, or fixed CSS box model metrics.
</p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2>Properties</h2>

<p>Select the <strong>Properties</strong> pane in the right-hand sidebar,
then expand <strong>Element</strong>.
  <div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_properties_paner.png"></div>
From here you can edit the element's DOM properties. Deleting all the text
deletes the property, if allowed.</p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>


<h2>DOM Breakpoints</h2>

<p>You can add breakpoints that fire on DOM modifications related to a certain element.
Bring up a context menu on the #profileCard element and select the events you want to break on:
subtree modifications, attributes modifications, and the node removal. Let's select "Attributes Modification"
for now. Mover your mouse over any gray rectangle with a name. Your JavaScript code will break inside tooltip.js
which tries to modify the "className" attribute of the #profileCard element. Press F8 to continue the JavaScript
execution. The code immediately breaks on an attribute modification once again. Now select DOM Breakpoints in
the right-hand sidebar.</p>

<div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_dom_breakpoints.png"></div>

<br/>
<p>
You will see a list of your DOM breakpoints (contains a single breakpoint you just added.) You can toggle
the breakpoint using a nearby checkbox to de-activate (and re-activate) it, or you can remove it altogether
using its context menu's "Remove Breakpoint" item.</p>

<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2>Event Listeners</h2>

<p>Select <b>Event Listeners</b> in the right-hand sidebar.
  <div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_event_listeners_gear.png"></div>
The event
listeners shown for the selected node are in the order in which they are
fired through the capturing and bubbling phases. This provides the most
accurate and useful information possible. Event listeners are separated
by type. If a node has both <b>onclick</b> and <b>onmouseover</b>
listeners they appear in different sections. You can also set your filter
preference using the <b>Gear Menu</b>. You can choose to see only the
listeners registered on the selected node, or the entire event flow.</p>
<p class="backtotop"><a href="#top">Back to top</a></p>

<h2>Search</h2>

<p>Type <strong>document.write</strong> in the search box. You should see incremental
search running:
  <div class="screenshot"><img src="elements-files/elements_search.png"></div>
The <strong>Elements</strong> panel supports XPath and CSS selectors as
queries, in addition to plain text. All search results are highlighted in
the DOM tree, the first match is revealed and selected.</p>
