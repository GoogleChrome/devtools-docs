<h2 id="remote-debugging-overview">Remote debugging overview</h2>

<p>The experience of your web content on mobile operates very differently than what users experience on the desktop.  The Google Chrome DevTools allow you to inspect, debug, and analyze the on-device experience with the full suite of tools you're used to, meaning you can use the Chrome DevTools on your development machine to debug a page on your mobile device.</p>

<p><div class="screenshot"><img width="722" alt="Debugging Chrome for Android using the Chrome Developer Tools" src="remote-debugging/remote-debug-overview.png"/></div></p>

<p>Debugging occurs over USB and as long as your mobile device is connected to your development machine, you can view and change HTML, scripts and styles until you get a bug-free page that behaves perfectly on all devices.</p>

<p>To begin remote debugging, you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>An Android phone or tablet with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&amp;hl=en">Chrome for Android</a> 28 or later installed from Google Play.</li>
<li>A USB cable to plug in your device. (Windows users will also need to install an <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html" target="_blank">appropriate USB device driver</a>.)</li>
<li>Chrome 28 or later installed on your development machine.</li>
</ul>

<p>When debugging a web application served from your development machine, you can also use
<a href="#reverse-port-forwarding">reverse port forwarding</a> to allow the mobile device to access a site from the development machine over USB. Reverse port forwarding requires Chrome 29 or later on the development machine, Chrome 28 or later on the mobile device.</p>

<h2 id="remote-debugging">Native USB Debugging</h2>

<h3>Chrome Beta (M32)</h3>

<p>As of Chrome Beta, the DevTools now support <strong>native USB debugging</strong> of connected devices. You no longer need to configure <a href="/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging">ADB</a> or the ADB plugin to see all instances of Chrome and the Chrome-powered <a href="/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging#debugging-webviews">WebView</a> on devices connected to your system.</p>

<p>You can find connected devices under <code>about:inspect</code></p>

<img src="/chrome-developer-tools/docs/remote-debugging/inspect.png"/>

<p>or via the Chrome hotdog menu > Tools > Inspect Devices:</p>

<img src="remote-debugging/tools.png"/>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> This update applies to both desktop Chrome Beta on Mac as well as
ChromeOS. Windows users will need to install  <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html">device drivers</a> to enable
communication between their devices.</p>

<h2>Chrome stable (M31)</h2>

<p>In the current Chrome stable, you will still need to enable USB debugging
via <code>about:flags</code>. To get this setup:</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Enable <code>about:flags/#enable-devtools-experiments</code> and <code>about:flags/#remote-debugging-raw-usb</code> flags (depending on your Chrome version,
  you might only need to do the first one).</li>
<li>Go to <code>about:inspect</code> and plug in your Android phone (with USB Debugging on).</li>
<li>Open Chrome Beta on your Android smartphone and visit any website.</li>
<li>Under about: inspect, check the "Discover USB Devices" box.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Older versions of Chrome (M30)</h3>

<p>Older versions of Chrome will still require the ADB Chrome extension in order to
remotely debug devices. For more information, read remote debugging with the <a href="#remote-debugging-chrome-extension">ADB Chrome extension</a>.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Chrome will prevent your screen from going to sleep while remote debugging. Be aware that whilst useful, this makes your device less secure.</p>

<h2 id="remote-debugging-chrome-extension">Remote debugging with the ADB Chrome extension</h2>

<p>If you are using a version of Chrome which doesn't yet support native USB debugging, the <a href="#install-adbplugin">ADB Chrome extension</a> can alternatively be used to simplify your remote debugging workflow</p>

<aside class="note"><strong>Note: </strong> If you are already using the legacy remote debugging workflow, or are
using an earlier version of Chrome, see
<a href="remote-debugging-legacy">Remote Debugging on Android (Legacy Workflow)</a>.</aside>

<h3 id="install-adbplugin">1. Install the ADB extension</h3>

<p>The ADB extension includes the Android Debug Bridge (ADB), which lets you debug the device over USB from your development machine. The extension provides the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes ADB so you don't have to install the full Android SDK.</li>
<li>Provides a UI for easily starting and stopping the ADB daemon, and viewing connected devices.</li>
</ul>

<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dpngiggdglpdnjdoaefidgiigpemgage">Install the ADB Chrome extension</a>
</div>

<aside class="note">The Chrome Web Store installation process does not work on Windows 8. If you have any trouble
installing from the Chrome Web Store, see the
<a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/ADBPlugin/#readme" target="_blank">ADB extension repo on github</a>
for details on how to download and install the extension manually.</aside>

<h3 id="enable-usb-debugging">2. Enable USB debugging on your device</h3>

<p>In order to debug over USB, you need to setup your Android device for
development.
Enable USB debugging on your device then system to detect your device as mentioned in the
guide.</p>

<p><strong>To enable USB debugging:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>On most devices running Android 3.2 or older, you can find the option under
<strong>Settings > Applications > Development.</strong></li>
<li>On Android 4.0 and newer, it's in <strong>Settings > Developer options</strong>.</li>
<li>On Android 4.2 and newer, <strong>Developer options</strong> is hidden by default. To make it
available, go to <strong>Settings > About phone</strong> and tap <strong>Build number</strong> seven times.
Return to the previous screen to find <strong>Developer options</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><div class="screenshot"><img width="500" alt="USB debugging settings in Developer options" src="remote-debugging/image_4.png"/></div></p>

<p>If you are developing on Windows, you need to install the appropriate USB driver for your device. See <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html" target="_blank">OEM USB Drivers</a> on the Android Developers site.</p>

<p>For more information see <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#setting-up">Setting up a Device for Development</a> on the Android Developers site.</p>

<h3 id="connect-device-via-usb">3. Connect your device via USB</h3>

<ol>
<li>Connect your mobile device to the development machine using a USB cable. </li>

<li>When connecting your device to your development machine, you may see
an alert on the device requesting permission for USB debugging from this computer.  To avoid seeing this alert each time you debug, check <b>Always allow from this computer</b> and click <b>OK</b></li>

</ol>

<div class="screenshot"><img alt="USB debugging permission alert" src="remote-debugging/usb-debugging-dialog.png" /></div>


<h3 id="start-debugging-with-adbplugin">4. Start debugging with the ADB extension </h3>

<p>When the ADB extension is installed, a gray Android menu icon appears beside the Chrome menu.</p>

<p><strong>To start debugging:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Click the Android icon, then click <b>Start ADB</b>.</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" width="149" alt="ADB extension menu" src="remote-debugging/adb-plugin-menu.png"/></p>

<p>Once ADB has started, the menu icon turns green and displays the number of currently connected devices, if any.</p>

<p><img class="screenshot" width="149" alt="ADB extension menu" src="remote-debugging/adb-plugin-menu-active.png"/></p>

</li>
<li>Click <b>View Inspection Targets</b> to open the <b>about:inspect</b> page that displays each connected device and its tabs.</li>
<li>Find the mobile device tab you want to debug and Click the <b>inspect</b> link next to its URL.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you <em>don't</em> see any connected devices:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check that your device is connected to USB.</li>
<li>Ensure your device is listed as available by issuing the <code>adb devices</code>
command. If not, check that you have USB debugging enabled on your
device.</li>
<li>Ensure that USB debugging is enabled in the Chrome for Android settings.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="debug-your-app">5. Debug Your Application</h3>

<p><div class="screenshot"><img width="700" alt="Inspecting a remote page using the Chrome Developer Tools" src="remote-debugging/elements-panel.png"/></div></p>

<p>For example, inspect an element in the page you have selected and
the element highlights in Chrome mobile on your device in real time.</p>

<p><div class="screenshot"><img width="350" alt="Element inspection on a remote device" src="remote-debugging/image_9.png"/></div></p>

<p>Similarly, editing scripts or executing commands from the DevTools console
affects the page being inspected on your device. You can also also use all of
the other panels, such as
<a href="timeline">Timeline</a> and
<a href="profiles">Profiles</a>.</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>You may notice that the version of the DevTools you have access to during
remote debugging differs to the version you have running on your development machine. This is
because the tools are synchronized with the Chrome version on the Android
device being used.</li>
<li>Because we're connected over USB, you can keep the device on a real cellular
network, and view the network waterfall in the Network panel under actual
network conditions</li>
<li>The hardware on mobile devices often runs your content much slower, so use the
<a href="timeline">Timeline</a> to analyze how to optimize
rendering and CPU for the best effect.</li>
<li>If you're running a web server on your development machine, and network restrictions prevent
your mobile device from accessing the server, see
<a href="#reverse-port-forwarding">reverse port forwarding</a></li>.
</ul>


<h2 id="screencasting">Screencasting your device's screen</h2>

<p>Using the Screencasting you are able to bring the experience of your device onto your machine. This allows you to keep your attention on one screen instead of switching back and forth between screen and the DevTools.</p>

<p>Clicking on the screencast icon <img alt="Screencast" src="remote-debugging/screencast0.png" /> in the toolbar opens up a panel on your computer displaying your device's screen. As you navigate, click, scroll, the screencast display will provide a live view of what's on your device.</p>

<p>While you are screencasting your device, you also have full control over the Back and Forward buttons, and you have the ability to type into the URL bar directly.</p>

<img alt="Screencast toolbar" src="remote-debugging/screencast2.png" />

<h3 id="interacting-with-screencast">Interacting with the screencast</h3>

<p>You can interact with the screencast of your device in a number of ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Type</strong> on your machine's keyboard and these keystrokes are sent to the device</li>
  <li><strong>Click</strong> to tap. Clicks will be sent to the device as proper touch events.</li>
  <li><strong>Scroll</strong> by mousewheel, trackpad, or by flinging the content with your pointer.</li>
  <li><strong>Inspect Element</strong> by selecting the magnifying glass or by pressing <span class="kbd">Cmd</span> + <span class="kbd">Shift</span> + <span class="kbd">C</span></li>
  <li><strong>Zoom</strong> with a simulated pinch gesture with <span class="kbd">Cmd</span> + <span class="kbd">Click with two fingers</span> + <span class="kbd">Drag</span></li>
  <li><strong>Resize</strong> the pane that screencast is in, to better view it's contents. (To make it bigger/smaller)</li>
  <li><strong>Transparent</strong> portions of the screencast are covered by things like the omnibox and keyboard. Only page content is being screencasted.</li>
</ul>

<div class="screenshot"><img alt="Screencasting device" src="remote-debugging/screencast1.png" /></div>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The screencast feature repeatedly snaps screenshots on the device to give you the live view, but this does have a performance overhead. Disable screencast if you're testing framerate-sensitive situations.</p>


<h2 id="debugging-webviews">Debugging Android WebViews</h2>

<p>
Starting Android 4.4 (KitKat), you can use the DevTools to debug the contents of
Android WebViews inside native Android applications. Debugging WebViews requires:
</p>

<ul>
<li>An Android device or emulator running Android 4.4 or later, with USB debugging enabled as
    described in
    <a href="#enable-usb-debugging"> 2. Enable USB debugging on your device </a>. </li>
<li>Chrome 30 or later. Enhanced WebView debugging UI is available in Chrome 31 or later.</li>
<li>An Android application with a WebView configured for debugging.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="configure-webview">Configure WebViews for debugging</h3>

<p>The <strong>Enable USB web debugging</strong> setting in Chrome doesn't affect WebViews. To
debug the contents of your WebView, you need to enable it programmatically from within your application by calling
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html#setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(boolean)">
setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled</a>, a static method on the <code>WebView</code> class.</p>

<pre>
if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {
    WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true);
}
</pre>

<p>This setting applies to all of the application's WebViews. Note that web debugging is <b>not</b> affected
by the state of the <code>debuggable</code> flag in the application's manifest. If you want to enable web debugging only
when <code>debuggable</code> is <code>true</code>, test the flag at runtime.</p>

<pre>
if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {
    if ( 0 != ( getApplcationInfo().flags &= ApplicationInfo.FLAG_DEBUGGABLE ) ) {
        WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true);
    }
}
</pre>

<h3 id="open-webview">Open a WebView in DevTools</h3>

<p>To debug a WebView in DevTools:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Connect your mobile device to the development machine using a USB cable.
<p>When connecting your device to your development machine, you may see
an alert on the device requesting permission for USB debugging from this computer.</p></li>
<p>To avoid seeing this alert each time you debug, check <b>Always allow from this computer</b> and click <b>OK</b>.</p></li>
<li>In Chrome on your development machine, open <b>about:inspect</b>.</li>
<li>You should see the name of your application and a list of debuggable WebViews. Click the <code>inspect</code> link
next to one of the tabs to inspect the WebView's contents in DevTools.</li>
</ol>

<aside class="note"><b>Note:</b> In Chrome 31 and later, the <b>about:inspect</b> page provides a graphic representing the WebView's
size and position relative to the device's screen. Prior to Chrome 31, the <b>about:inspect</b> page only supplies the WebView's title.
Setting a title on all of your WebViews simpifies the process of picking the correct WebView.</aside>

<div class="screenshot"><img src="remote-debugging/about-inspect-webview.gif"></div>

<h2 id="reverse-port-forwarding">Port Forwarding</h2>

<p>Commonly you have a web server running on your local development machine, and you want to
connect to that site from your device. If the mobile device and the development machine are
on the same network, this is straightforward. But this may be difficult in some cases, like
on a restricted corporate network.</p>

<p>Chrome for Android supports port fowarding making this workflow very simple to do.
It works by creating a listening TCP port on your mobile device that maps to a particular TCP
port on your development machine. The traffic through the forwarded port travels over USB, so
it doesn't depend on the mobile device's network configuration.</p>

<p>To use this feature you need:</p>

<p>This procedure assumes that you already have remote debugging configured as described in
<a href="#remote-debugging">Remote debugging with the ADB Chrome extension</a> or
<a href="remote-debugging-legacy">Remote Debugging on Android (Legacy Workflow)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="connect-your-mobile-device">1. Connect your mobile device</h3>
<ol>
<li>Connect your device to your development machine over USB.</li>
<li>Stop all instances of Chrome currently running on the mobile device.</li>
<li>Open Chrome for Android.</li>
<li>Start ADB on your development machine:
<ul>
<li>If you're using the ADB extension, click the ADB icon and click <b>Start ADB</b>. You should see the icon turn green and display a number indicating the number of devices connected.</li>
<li>If you're not using the extension, open a terminal and run <kbd>adb devices</kbd>. You should see the IDs of your connected device(s) listed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="enable-reverse-port-forwarding">2. Enable port forwarding</h3>


Perform the following steps on Chrome on your development machine:
<ol>
<li>Open <b>about:inspect</b>. You should see your mobile device and a list of its open tabs.
<li>Click <b>Port Forwarding</b> button at the top.</li>
<li>In the Device port field, enter the port number the Android should device listen on (defaults to 8080).
<li>In the Host field, add the IP and port number where your web application is running on localhost.</li>
<li>Make sure to check <b>Enable port forwarding</b> before hitting <b>Done</b>.
</ol>

<h3 id="profit">3. Profit</h3>

<p>On <b>about:inspect</b> you should now see a green circle indicating your port forwarding is succssful.
Now, enter in your local URL into the <b>Open tab</b> field and hit <b>Go</b> to open it on your device's browser.</p>

<p>You should see the content being served by your development machine.</p>
