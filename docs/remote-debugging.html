<h1>Remote Debugging on Android with Chrome</h1>

<p>The experience of your web content on mobile devices can operate very differently than what users experience on the desktop. Get a bug-free page that behaves perfectly across all devices by using Google Chrome DevTools on your development machine to inspect, debug, and analyze browser tabs and WebViews on your Android device.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-device">Set up remote debugging</h2>

<p>To begin remote debugging, you will need:</p>

<ul>
<li>For <strong>browser tabs</strong>: Android 4.0+ and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.chrome&amp;hl=en">Chrome for Android</a>.</li>
<li>For <strong>Android apps</strong>: Android 4.4+ and a WebView <a href="#configure-webview">configured for debugging</a>.</li>
<li>A USB cable to plug in your Android device</li>
<li>Chrome 32 or later installed on your development machine</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="enable-usb-debugging">1. Enable USB debugging on your Android device</h3>

<p>On your Android device, go to <b>Settings > Developer options</b>.</p>

<div class="note">
  On <strong>Android 4.2</strong> and newer, the developer options are hidden by default.
  <p>To make it available, go to <b>Settings > About phone</b> and tap <b>Build number</b> seven times. Yup, just tap it 7 times, even if it seems crazy. Then, return to the previous screen to find <b>Developer options</b>.</p>

<h3 id="enable-usb-discovery">2. Enable USB discovery in Chrome</h3>

<p>On your desktop Chrome browser, go to <b>chrome://inspect</b>. Alternatively, to get to the same screen, you can select <b>Chrome menu > Tools > Inspect Devices</b>.</p>

<p>Confirm that <b>Discover USB Devices</b> is checked:<p>

<figure>

</figure>

<h3 id="connect-device-via-usb">3. Connect your device via USB</h3>

<p>Connect your mobile device to the development machine using a USB cable.</p>

<p class="note">If you are developing on <strong>Windows</strong>, install the appropriate USB driver for your device. See <a href="http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html" target="_blank">OEM USB Drivers</a> on the Android Developers site.</p>

<p>After connecting, you may see an alert on the device requesting permission for USB debugging from your computer:</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="USB debugging permission alert" src="remote-debugging/usb-debugging-dialog.png" />
</figure>

<p>To avoid seeing this alert each time you debug, check <b>Always allow from this computer</b>. Tap <b>OK</b>.</p>

<h3 id="debug-remote">4. Debug a remote web view</h3>

<p>Once you have set up your device for debugging over USB, the <b>chrome://inspect</b> page displays every connected device, along with its open tabs and debug-enabled WebViews:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="remote-debugging/about-inspect-stuff.png">
  <figcaption>Check <b>Discover USB devices</b> and plug in your mobile device to see your phone or tablet show up in <b>chrome://inspect</b>.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Find the tab or WebView you're interested in and click the <b>inspect</b> link to open DevTools on it:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="remote-debugging/inspect-open-tab.png" alt="Click inspect to start remote debugging">
</figure>

<p>Open new browser tabs on the remote device by typing the URL in the text input field, then click <b>Open</b>.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="remote-debugging/open-new-remote-tab.png" alt="Click inspect to start remote debugging">
</figure>

<h3 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h3>

<ul>
  <li>On your device, verify you have <b>USB debugging</b> turned on. When you connect your device to a laptop, there will be a "USB debugging connected" item in the notification drawer of your phone or tablet.</li>
  <li>On your desktop, verify you are using Chrome version 32 or later. You can check the version number in <b>chrome://version</b>.</li>
  <li>If USB debugging is on but <b>chrome://inspect</b> doesn't show your device, check that <b>Discover USB devices</b> is checked. If so, unplug the device and try revoking all the USB authorizations in the Android <b>Developer options</b> to retry. Be sure to connect the device directly to your machine, bypassing any hubs.</li>
  <li>If you're running a web server on your development machine, and network restrictions prevent your mobile device from accessing the server, try <a href="#reverse-port-forwarding">enabling port forwarding</a> or setting up a <a href="#virtual-host-mapping">virtual host map</a>.</li>
  <li>Lastly, if things still are not working, you may have to try the <a href="remote-debugging-legacy">legacy workflow for remote debugging</a> via the <code>adb</code> binary from the Android SDK.</li>

</ul>

<section class="collapsible">
<h2 id="debug-your-app">Debug browser tabs</h2>

<p>When inspecting a remote browser tab in Chrome for Android, the element you are mousing over in the DevTools window will highlight the element on your device in real time. In fact, turn on inspect mode by clicking the <img src="../images/inspect-icon.png" class="inspect-icon" alt="Inspect icon"> icon, and then tap on your device screen.</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Debugging Chrome for Android using the Chrome Developer Tools" src="remote-debugging/remote-debug-overview.jpg"/>
  <figcaption>Debug a web page loaded on your Android phone from your laptop using Chrome DevTools.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Similarly, editing scripts or executing commands from the DevTools console affects the page being inspected on your device. You can also also use all of the other panels, such as <a href="timeline">Timeline</a> and <a href="cpu-profiling">Profiles</a>.</p>

<h3 id="tips">Debugging tips</h3>

<ul>
<li>Reload the remote page from the DevTools window using <span class="kbd">F5</span> (or <span class="kbd">Cmd</span>+<span class="kbd">R</span> on Mac).</li>
<li>Keep the device on a real cellular
network to view the network waterfall in the <b>Network</b> panel under actual
network conditions.</li>
<li>The hardware on mobile devices often run your content much slower, so use the <a href="timeline">Timeline</a> to analyze how to optimize rendering and CPU for the best effect.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Closing the DevTools window has no effect on the remote device.</li>
<li>Chrome will prevent your screen from going to sleep while remote debugging. Be aware that whilst useful, this makes your device less secure.</li>
<li>You may notice that the version of the DevTools you have access to during remote debugging differs to the version you have running on your development machine. This is because the tools are synchronized with the Chrome on Android version in use.</li>
</ul>

<section class="collapsible">
<h2 id="debugging-webviews">Debug WebViews</h2>

<p>Starting Android 4.4 (KitKat), you can use the DevTools to debug the contents of
Android WebViews inside native Android applications.
</p>

<p>The procedure for debugging WebViews is very similar to what was outlined in the <a href="#setting-up-device">Set up your device for remote debugging</a> section except the <strong>Enable USB web debugging</strong> setting in Chrome doesn't affect WebViews.</p>

<h3 id="configure-webview">Configure WebViews for debugging</h3>

<p>To debug the contents of your WebView, you need to enable it programmatically from within your application by calling
<a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/webkit/WebView.html#setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(boolean)">
setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled</a>, a static method on the <code>WebView</code> class.</p>

<pre>
if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {
    WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true);
}
</pre>

<p>This setting applies to all of the application's WebViews. Note that web debugging is <strong>not</strong> affected
by the state of the <code>debuggable</code> flag in the application's manifest. If you want to enable web debugging only
when <code>debuggable</code> is <code>true</code>, test the flag at runtime.</p>

<pre>
if(Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.KITKAT) {
    if ( 0 != ( getApplcationInfo().flags &= ApplicationInfo.FLAG_DEBUGGABLE ) ) {
        WebView.setWebContentsDebuggingEnabled(true);
    }
}
</pre>

<h3 id="open-webview">Open a WebView in DevTools</h3>

<p>Go to <b>chrome://inspect</b> in Chrome to get a list of debuggable WebViews, along with a graphic representing the WebView's size and position relative to the device's screen. If your WebViews have titles set, those will show as well. Click <b>inspect</b> on the WebView you wish to debug and use the DevTools as you would for a remote browser tab.</p>

<section class="collapsible">
<h2 id="screencasting">Screencasting</h2>

<p>Screencasting lets you bring the experience of your device onto your machine. This allows you to keep your attention on one screen instead of switching back and forth between the device and the DevTools. As of KitKat 4.4.3, screencasting in now also available for Android WebViews.</p>

<p>While debugging a remote device, you will see a screencast icon in the DevTools toolbar:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="remote-debugging/screencast-button.png">
</figure>

<p>Clicking on the screencast icon <img alt="Screencast" src="remote-debugging/screencast0.png"> opens up a panel on your computer displaying your  device's screen:</p>

<figure>
  <img alt="Screencasting device" src="remote-debugging/screencast1.png">
</figure>

<p>Watch a video of screencasting in action:</p>

<div class="video-container">

  <iframe width="640" height="360" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/Q7rEFEMpwe4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="interacting-with-screencast">Interacting with the screencast</h3>

<p>You can interact with the screencast of your device in a number of ways.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Type</strong> on your machine's keyboard and these keystrokes are sent to the device</li>
  <li><strong>Click</strong> to tap. Clicks will be sent to the device as proper touch events.</li>
  <li><strong>Scroll</strong> by mousewheel, trackpad, or by flinging the content with your pointer.</li>
  <li><strong>Inspect Element</strong> by selecting the Inspect Element button <img src="../images/inspect-icon.png" alt="inspect icon"> or by pressing <span class="kbd">Cmd</span> + <span class="kbd">Shift</span> + <span class="kbd">C</span></li>
  <li><strong>Zoom</strong> with a simulated pinch gesture with <span class="kbd">Cmd</span> + <span class="kbd">Click with two fingers</span> + <span class="kbd">Drag</span></li>
  <li><strong>Resize</strong> the pane that screencast is in to better size its contents. </li>
  <li><strong>Transparent</strong> portions of the screencast are covered by things like the omnibox and keyboard. Only page content is being screencasted.</li>
</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The screencast feature does have a performance overhead, due to continuously capturing frames. Disable screencast if you're testing framerate-sensitive situations.</p>

<section class="collapsible">
<h2 id="reverse-port-forwarding">Port forwarding</h2>

<p>Commonly you have a web server running on your local development machine, and you want to
connect to that site from your device. If the mobile device and the development machine are
on the same network, this is straightforward. But this may be difficult in some cases, like
on a restricted corporate network.</p>

<p>Chrome for Android supports port fowarding making this workflow very simple to do.
It works by creating a listening TCP port on your mobile device that maps to a particular TCP
port on your development machine. The traffic through the forwarded port travels over USB, so
it doesn't depend on the mobile device's network configuration.</p>

<h3 id="enable-reverse-port-forwarding">Enable port forwarding</h3>

<p>This procedure assumes that you already have remote debugging configured and working. On your development machine within Chrome:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="remote-debugging/port-forwarding-settings.png">
</figure>

<ol>
<li>Open <b>chrome://inspect</b>.</li>
<li>Click <b>Port Forwarding</b> button at the top.</li>
<li>In the Device port field, enter the port number the Android should device listen on (defaults to 8080).
<li>In the Host field, add the IP (or hostname) and port number where your web application is running. This location can be any local location accessible from your development machine. Currently, it is limited to ports over 1024 and under 65535 (inclusive).</li>
<li>Make sure to check <b>Enable port forwarding</b> before hitting <b>Done</b>.
</ol>

<p>On <b>chrome://inspect</b> you should now see a green circle indicating your port forwarding is succssful.
Now, enter in your local URL into the <b>Open tab</b> field and hit <b>Go</b> to open it on your device's browser.</p>

<p>You should see the content being served by your development machine:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="remote-debugging/portforward.png">
</figure>

<h3 id="virtual-host-mapping">Virtual host mapping</h3>

<p>Follow the instructions for virtual host mapping to preview customised local domains (something other than <code>localhost</code>) on your device. Consider the following use cases for local development to understand where this is useful:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You use a customised domain during development such as <b>http://local.dev</b> configured through any number of means, such as virtual hosts on your WebServer (e.g. <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/mamp-pro/features/webserver.html">MAMP</a>).</li>
  <li>You add a hosts file entry such as <code>127.0.0.1 production.com</code> as the third party JavaScript SDK on your page only works on a whitelisted domain.</li>
</ul>

<p>To configure virtual host mapping with Chrome for Android, the device will need to communicate with a proxy installed on the host machine.</p>

<strong>On the Android device:</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Open Wi-Fi settings.</li>
  <li>Long-press the current network. (The proxy setting is per-network.)</li>
  <li>Select <b>Modify network</b>.</li>
  <li>Tap the <b>Show advanced options</b> checkbox below <b>IP Address</b>.</li>
  <li><b>Proxy settings</b> will appear. Select <b>Manual</b>.</li>
  <li>Set <b>Proxy hostname</b> to <code>localhost</code>.</li>
  <li>Set <b>Proxy port</b> to a port that Android will let you use, for example <code>9000</code>.</li>
  <li>Tap <b>Save</b>.</li>
</ol>

<figure>
  <img width="250" alt="Android Wi-Fi proxy settings" src="remote-debugging/android-proxy-settings.jpg"/>
</figure>

<strong>On the host machine:</strong>
<ol>
  <li>Install proxy software such as <a href="http://www.charlesproxy.com/">Charles Proxy</a> (free trial available) or <a href="http://www.squid-cache.org/">Squid</a>. </li>
  <li>Make note of the port the proxy is using. In Charles, you can access this via <b>Proxy > Proxy Settings</b> and making note of the port number in the <b>HTTP Proxy > Port</b> field.</li>
  <li>Navigate to <b>chrome://inspect/#devices</b> on Google Chrome.</li>
  <li>Select <b>Port forwarding</b>.</li>
  <li>Enter <code>9000</code> in the <b>Port</b> field.</li>
  <li>Enter <code>localhost:1234</code> where <code>1234</code> is the port retrieved in step 2.</li>
  <li>Ensure the <b>Enable port forwarding</b> checkbox is checked.</li>
</ol>

<p>The steps above are required <strong>once</strong> per development session. Once port forwarding has been configured to forward requests to the host machine's proxy (from the device), you can load local domains on Chrome for Android just as you would on the host machine. </p>

<h2>Additional information</h2>

<h3>Remote debugging and ADB</h3>

<p>DevTools supports direct USB debugging of connected devices. You no longer need to configure ADB or the ADB plugin to see all instances of Chrome and the Chrome-powered WebView on devices connected to your system. This functionality works on all operating systems: Windows, Mac, Linux and Chrome OS.</p>

<aside class="note">However, if you do encounter problems, you can try the legacy workflow for connectivity which uses the <code>adb</code> binary from the Android SDK:
<a href="remote-debugging-legacy">Remote Debugging on Android (Legacy Workflow)</a>.</aside>

<p>If you use the <code>adb</code> binary for other reasons, please note the direct USB connection between Chrome and the device may interrupt an <code>adb</code> connection that you may be trying to establish. To fix, just uncheck the <b>Discover USB Devices</b> checkbox, unplug the device, and plug it back in, before establishing your connection via <code>adb</code>.</p>



<h3>Remote debugging for DevTools extension developers</h3>

<p>For information on the interaction protocol we use for our remote debugging, please see the <a href="debugger-protocol">Debugger Protocol</a> documentation and <a href="/extensions/debugger">chrome.debugger</a>.</p>
