        <p>
          <strong>To modify the Settings in DevTools:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Click on the Settings cog <img src="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/mobile-emulation/image_38.png"> and open up the Settings pane.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/settings.png">
        </div>

        <h2 id="general">General</h2>


        <h4>Disable cache</h4>
        <p>Will prevent the caching of resources <strong>ONLY</strong> for pages which have DevTools open. This will not disable caching if the DevTools are closed.</p>


        <h4>Disable JavaScript</h4>
        <p>Immediately suspends all JavaScript from running on the tab running the instance of DevTools which has this checked.</p>


        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Both the Disable cache and Disable JavaScript settings will <strong>ONLY</strong> apply when DevTools is open. When it is open, for the page which has the DevTools open.</p>


        <h4>Enable Ctrl + 1-9 shortcuts to switch panels</h4>
        <p>You are able to use <span class="kbd">Ctrl</span> + <span class="kbd">1-9</span> shortcuts to jump to specific tabs in Chrome when multiple tabs are open, with tabs 1-8 and 9 being the last tab if more than 9 are open. This setting will enable DevTools to function in the same way, so you are able to switch between panels quickly.</p>

        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Enabling this may cause conflicts with shortcut keys that are used by other applications.</p>


        <h3 id="appearance">Appearance</h3>


        <h4>Show toolbar icons</h4>
        <p>With this setting you can choose to show the icons for each panel in DevTools or not. You can save some space in the window by unchecking this option to hide the icons and show text for each panel instead. This is especially useful when DevTools is docked to the right side of the window.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/hide-icons.png">
        </div>

        <p>Hiding the icons will save <strong>30px</strong> of vertical space making that much more visible within the panels.</p>


        <h4>Split panels vertically when docked to right</h4>
        <p>Enabling this will change the layout of the panels so the main section is stacked on top of the sidebar sections. You may find this useful when there is not enough horizontal space when they are side-by-side which is the case for smaller screens.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/dock-to-right.png">
        </div>


        <h3 id="elements">Elements</h3>

        <h4>Color format</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>As authored - <strong>(how the code was written in the stylesheet)</strong></li>
          <li>HEX: <code>#DAC0DE</code></li>
          <li>RGB: <code>rgb(128, 255, 255)</code></li>
          <li>HSL: <code>hsl(300, 80%, 90%)</code></li>
        </ul>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/color-format.png">
        </div>

        <p>The <strong>Color format</strong> setting lets you control how the color codes are displayed in the <strong>Styles Sidebar</strong> of the Elements panel. In addition to the Settings option for controlling the color format, you can click on the gear icon at the top of the Styles Sidebar to change the format of color codes.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/color-format2.png">
        </div>

        <p>Selecting <strong>As authored</strong> will use the color format for properties as defined in the stylesheet.</p>


        <h4>Show user agent styles</h4>
        <p>You may find it useful to show <strong>user agent styles</strong> in the Styles Sidebar of the Elements panel.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/user-agent-styles.png">
        </div>

        <p>The <strong>user agent</strong> refers to the browser. Each browser implements a default stylesheet consisting of basic style rules which are applied to DOM Elements in a page. If you've ever had a difficult time removing white-space between two elements, for example, it may have been because of the user agent stylesheet adding a default margin or padding to that particular type of element.</p>


        <h4>Word wrap</h4>
        <p>As with any text editor you can choose to wrap long lines of code in the Elements panel.</p>


        <h4>Show Shadow DOM</h4>
        <p>With <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webcomponents/shadowdom/">Shadow DOM</a>, elements can get a new kind of node associated with them. This new kind of node is called a <strong>shadow root</strong>. An element that has a shadow root associated with it is called a shadow host. The child nodes of a shadow host isn't rendered; the content of the shadow root is rendered instead.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/shadow-dom.png">
        </div>

        </ul>


        <h4>Show rulers</h4>
        <p>This will display a ruler overlay along the top, left and bottom sides of the viewport.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/show-ruler.png">
        </div>


        <h3 id="rendering">Rendering</h3>


        <h4>Show paint rectangles</h4>
        <p>
          When this is enabled you be able to see the regions where Chrome paints. This can help diagnose and ultimately <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/unnecessary-paints/">avoid unnecessary paints</a> on a page. You can also use this to <a href="http://www.paulirish.com/2011/viewing-chromes-paint-cycle/">study painting behaviors</a> just by hovering over links, popups, or some content which dynamically updates.
        </p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/show-paint-rects.png">
        </div>

        <p>Furthermore, showing paint rectangles shows repainted areas for each frame making it easy to visualize what slows pages down. Ideally you want to keep the number of areas being repainted as low as possible.</p>


        <h4>Show composited layer borders</h4>
        <p>This highlights where layers are on-screen. Use this to <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/layers/">accelerate render times</a> in Chrome. It can help to reduce the time it takes to render elements which may be animating or have CSS transforms/transitions applied to them that change the shape or positioning of the element.</p>

        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The blue grid represents tiles, which you can think of as sub-units of a layer that Chrome uses to upload parts of a large layer at a time to the GPU. They aren't really too important in most cases.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/composited-layer-borders.png">
        </div>

        <p>Enabling <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6qe_kVaBpg&t=23m42s">Show paint rectangles and Show layer borders</a> together can also be useful for finding any unnecessary paints which occur and cause a relayout on the Timeline panel.</p>


        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Show paint rectangles and composited layer borders settings will only apply when DevTools is open.</p>


        <h4>Show FPS meter</h4>
        <p>Overlays an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6qe_kVaBpg&t=23m17s">FPS meter</a> at the top right of the browser window which updates in real-time.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/fps-meter.png">
          <img src="settings-files/fps-memory-meter.png">
        </div>

        <p>When running Chrome on Android you may also <strong>show a GPU memory meter</strong> as part of the overlay. Enabling the FPS meter is <em></em>specially helpful when developing pages that have animations.</p>


        <h4>Enable continuous page repainting</h4>
        <p>This is a tool that helps you <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/mobile/profiling/">identify elements</a> on the page which are costly. The page will <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6qe_kVaBpg&t=22m51s">continuously repaint</a>, showing a counter of <a href="http://updates.html5rocks.com/2013/02/Profiling-Long-Paint-Times-with-DevTools-Continuous-Painting-Mode">how much painting work is happening</a>. Then, you can hide elements and mutate styles, watching the counter, in order to figure out what is slow.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/continuous-page-repainting.png">
        </div>


        <h3 id="sources">Sources</h3>

        <h4>Search in content scripts</h4>
        <p><a href="http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/content_scripts.html">Content scripts</a> are JavaScript files contained within Chrome extensions that run in the context of web pages but from a protected scope that is completely separate from ordinary page JavaScript. As such, content scripts and page scripts cannot interact with each other in an ordinary way.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/content-scripts.png">
        </div>

        <p>When looking at the <strong>Content Scripts</strong> tab in the Sources panel you will see both the scripts added by extensions (<em>or by <a href="http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/user-scripts">User Scripts</a> which are compiled into extensions in Chrome</em>), and also content scripts that are built-in parts of the browser, specifically the API that extensions can use.</p>

        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When developing Chrome apps or extensions enabling this setting is so you can search within these native API scripts is useful, otherwise it is not useful having it enabled.</p>


        <h4>Enable source maps</h4>
        <p>If you have code which is concatenated and minified it is difficult to tell what file a piece of code may be in when you need to debug it. Enabling this setting is useful for <a href="https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/javascript-debugging#source-maps">debugging JavaScript</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HijZNR6kc9A#t=1m32s">working with Source maps</a> in general.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/source-maps.png">
        </div>


        <h4>Auto-reload CSS upon Sass save</h4>
        <p>This requires setting will not be visible unless the experiment for <strong>Sass stylesheet debugging</strong> installing <strong>SASS</strong> along with <strong>Compass</strong> (<em>or another similar tool</em>) watch your SASS files for changes and recompile the CSS on the fly, in addition to enabling the <strong>Source Maps</strong> setting.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/sass-auto-reload.png">
        </div>

        <p>To install SASS and Compass you can run the following commands, assuming you have Ruby installed.</p>

        <pre><code>
          sudo gem install sass --pre<br />
          sudo gem install compass
        </code></pre>

        <p>With SASS and Compass installed, the <em>magic encantation</em> you must run to watch your changes update live is:</p>

        <p><code>sass --watch --compass --sourcemap css/sass/style.scss:css/style.css</code></p>

        <dl>
          <dt><strong>Timeout (ms):</strong> <code>1000</code></dt>
          <dd>Control the length of delay in milliseconds between when you save a change to a <code>.scss</code> file and the when the browser refreshes the <code>.css</code> file and visible to you on the page. The default value here may soon be increased to 1500ms soon since this seems a little too fast.</dd>
        </dl>


        <h4>Indentation:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>2 spaces</li>
          <li>4 spaces</li>
          <li>8 spaces</li>
          <li>Tab character</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Many developers have different preferences for how to indent their code. Most text-editors these days provide a way to define this and so does DevTools. From this select menu you can control how the code within DevTools should be indented.</p>


        <h4>Show whitespace characters</h4>
        <p>This will show dots for spaces and tab characters in the Sources panel.</p>


        <h3 id="profiler">Profiler</h3>

        <h4>Show objects' hidden properties</h4>
        <p></p>


        <h4 id="uninstrumented-native-memory">Show uninstrumented native memory</h4>
        <p>This setting will be visible on the main Settings pane when the <a href="#native-memory-profiling">Native memory profiling experiment</a> is enabled. When you capture native memory distribution you may choose to <strong>Show the uninstrumented native memory</strong> that is used which is not within the JavaScript heap.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/uninstrumented-native-memory.png">
        </div>

        <p>The gray bars in the chart show the uninstrumented native memory being used.</p>

        <h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3>

        <h4>Show CPU activity on the ruler</h4>
        <p>Enabling this setting will display the CPU activity in the ruler and appear as gray bars along the bottom of the timeline chart. When you hover over the gray bars you will see the details of the CPU activity for it, with just that bar highlighted.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/show-cpu-activity-hover.png">
        </div>

        <h4>Limit number of captured JS stack frames</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>-- Frames to capture:</strong> <code>30</code></li>
        </ul>

        <p>Controls the depth of the stack retrieved from the <strong>Timeline Events</strong> that are produced within JavaScript. Most of the time, the overhead associated with collecting the stack is negligible. However, for certain pages with long script URLs and deep call stacks, collecting stacks may skew the performance of the page or result in a very large logs. So you can reduce the performance impact by tweaking the number of stack frames we capture and display with each event.</p>


        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Setting the option to <strong>0</strong> will entirely turn off stack sampling.</p>


        <h3 id="console">Console</h3>


        <h4>Log XMLHttpRequests</h4>
        <p>Display XHR request objects in the console which expand to show details of the request.</p>


        <h4>Preserve log upon navigation</h4>
        <p>When navigating through multiple pages of a site you may choose to not clear the console logs with each page load so you can view the history of output across pages.</p>

        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Both of these settings can be changed by right clicking on the console.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/right-click-console.png">
        </div>


        <h3 id="extensions">Extensions</h3>

        <strong>Open links in:</strong> <code>a panel chosen automatically</code>
        <p></p>


        <h2 id="workspace">Workspace</h2>

        <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqfoYaKCYUI#t=3m39s">Workspaces</a> allow you to select <strong>custom directories</strong> in your file system which are always available for you to edit within the <strong>Sources panel</strong>. This can be one specific project directory or a directory that contains multiple different projects within it.</p>

        <p>To use this feature it open the <strong>Workspaces tab</strong> via the Settings pane. Here you will see an <strong>Add Folder</strong> link allowing you to add local directories for editing (eg: project root directories).</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/workspace.png">
        </div>

        <p>Once you've added a folder directory, you will be able to view, edit and save changes to files within it anytime you are working in the Sources panel. All changes to files will persist down to local file contained in directory.</p>

        <p>In addition to adding a file system for your Workspace, you are also able to add file <strong>Mappings</strong> individual file urls to the path of the file on your local machine.</p>


        <h2 id="port-forwarding">Port forwarding</h2>

        <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6qe_kVaBpg&t=14m45s">Port Forwarding</a> allows you to create a TCP port listener on your device which you can map to a TCP port here that will be accessible from the host machine.</p>

        <p><strong>Device port:</strong> <code>8080</code></p>

        <p><strong>Target:</strong> <code>127.0.0.1</code></p>

        <p>Using this feature you are also able to make use of Workspaces and the DevTools editor in Sources while viewing the changes on your device, and all of the DevTools features as well.</p>

        <p>To do this, you simply set the <strong>device port</strong> to the port number you want, and set the <strong>target</strong> to be the host machine's IP address (<em>localhost would be 127.0.0.1</em>). Then on your device, visit <strong>localhost:9000</strong> and you will have access to the DevTools for the device on your local machine.</p>

        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> You must enable this feature in the Settings pane &gt; <a href="#portfowarding">Experiments tab</a> to be able to use it. Once enabled, you will be able to access the Port Forwarding tab in the Settings pane.</p>


        <h2 id="experiments">Experiments</h2>


        <p class="special"><strong>These are experimental features which are actively developed.</strong> It is entirely possible for them to break because of this. Due to how frequently these features change, any documentation explaining how an experimental feature functions or its usage may not be entirely up-to-date. </p>


        <p>To enable the Experiments tab of the Settings pane you need to navigate to <code>about:flags</code> and scroll down to the <strong>Experimental Developer Tools experiments</strong> flag. Enable it then restart the browser.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/experiments-flag.png">
        </div>

        <p>Once Chrome re-opens, open up the Settings pane &gt; <strong>Experiments tab</strong> that is now available.</p>


        <h4 id="native-memory-profiling">Native memory profiling</h4>
        <p>With the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdsummsTeLo#t=1247s">Native memory profiling</a> experiment enabled, two <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdsummsTeLo#t=1247s"> additional profiling tools</a> will be available on the Profiles panel which you can use to take <strong>native heap snapshots</strong> and also <strong>capture native memory distribution</strong>.</p>

        <p>With these you can get a better understanding of how the render process is consuming memory which may not be within the V8 heap. It lets you know how much memory is used by the major components in your app; <em>CSS, DOM, the render tree, fonts, images, JavaScript heap</em> and so on.</p>

        <div class="screenshot">
          <img src="settings-files/native-memory-profiling.png">
        </div>

        <p>The <strong>native heap snapshot</strong> option works much the same as the regular heap snapshot profiler does only it shows you the native memory heap. This includes anything consuming memory which may not be within the V8 heap (Chrome JavaScript engine).</p>

        <p>Once you <strong>capture the native memory distribution</strong> you can determine what is using a lot of memory whether it is your Page structures or other resources that are being loaded and using memory.</p>

        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> An additional option to <a href="#uninstrumented-native-memory">Show uninstrumented native memory</a> is added to the main Settings pane when this Experiment is turned on.</p>

        <p>The DevTools heap profiler tool is helpful for <a href="http://addyosmani.com/blog/taming-the-unicorn-easing-javascript-memory-profiling-in-devtools/">finding memory leaks</a> but it is limited to memory which is allocated in the V8 heap only. The DOM tree may be consuming a lot of memory while the heap remains small. In cases like this the heap profiler will not be very helpful.</p>


        <h4>Native memory timeline</h4>
        <p>This setting replaces the <strong>DOM counters</strong> view on the Timeline panel when viewing the <strong>Memory</strong> section with a <strong>dynamic memory distribution</strong> graph.
